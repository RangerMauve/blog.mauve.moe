# Agregore

### Using Standard Web APIs to Mix P2P Protocols

<small>Press <b>P</b> for speaker notes</small>

???

Hi friends, thank you for coming out.

Today I'll be talking about how I'm using standard web APIS to Mix P2P protocols in Agregore

---

class: center, middle, purplebg

## [Mauve](https://blog.mauve.moe/) / [@RangerMauve](https://twitter.com/RangerMauve)

### [Mauve Software Inc.](https://software.mauve.moe/)

???

I'm Mauve, or @RangerMauve.

I do consulting through my company Mauve Software Inc.

And I'm high key obsessed with local first software and the web

---

class: center, middle, agbg

# What ü§î

- A Minimalist Web Browser
- A Mix of Protocols
- Fun

???

So what is Agregore?

Basically, It's a minimalist web browser that mixes a bunch of protocols together

And it tries to do the absolute minimum to be a browser,

while trying to be extendable, and fun to work with.

---

class: center, middle, datbg

# Why üîç

???

So why did I start working on Agregore?

There's a lot of p2p protocols

and each Each has their own strengths

and their own APIs

It felt like there was a way to make it easier to use them together

And to simplify how you could work with them

As well, I was frustrated that browers don't let us do "real" p2p

And wanted a browser that could leverage local networks without

extra gateways or setup

---

class: center, middle

## Goals:

- Simplify local-first tech
- Be open to anything p2p
- Be minimal & customizable
- Partner with community networks

???

With that said, here are the projects goals

We want to simplify creating and distribute local-first tech

We want to be open to working with any p2p projects

We want to stay minimal and customizable

And we want to partner with community network projects

Because they stand to gain the most from building on local-first tech

---

class: center, middle, agbg

## How üìù

???

So how is agregore approaching these goals?

---

class: center, middle, agbg

### Electron + P2P + Extensions = üíú

???

Well, Agregore is built on Electron in order to make it easier to 

contribute new protocols 

and to reuse as much as possible from 

the Node and Web ecosystem.

---

class: center, middle

### `ipfs://` `ipns://` `hyper://` `dat://` `gemini://`

### `your thing here://`

???

In addition, we support various protocols as first class citizens of the web.

So far we have support for multiple protocols

ipfs, ipns, hypercore protocol, dat, and gemini

And we're interested to add yours to the list

---

class: center, middle

# üíú URLs Are Awesome üíú

???

As you may have noticed, all these protocols come with their own URL scheme

And in my opinion URLs are awesome and are one of the best parts of the web.

All of these protocols can mix together thanks to the web's ability to hyperlink between different resources

For example, a page loaded in hypercore can load content from IPFS and the legacy web at once

Intead of having all those ecosystems isolated in separate apps

We can mix them together on the web

---

class: center, middle

# `fetch("agregore://")`

???

The way that works is that

These protocols are all abstracted behind the Browser's fetch API

This makes it so that you can interact with any protocol in the same way you would a web server

This also simplifies the amount of things a person needs to learn to use different protocols if they're already familiar with the web

But We'll get back to that in a demo in a sec

---

class: center, middle, agbg

## Extensions üõ†Ô∏è

???

On top of this core, we have a thin shell which provides additional functionality via standard web extensions.

In fact, even the history tracking is done entirely within an extension and can be customized or ripped out.

---

class: center, middle, purplebg

## üéâ Demo Time üéâ

???

So wtih that in mind, I'd like to give you a hands on demo.

Open agregore homepage

Go to hypercore protocol site, copy logo

Go to ipfs protocol site, copy logo

Go to `hyper://speakeasy`

Show PUT for index.html, with Hello World

Import agregore://theme/style.css

Add hypercore-protocol logo

Add ipfs logo

Wrap them in marquee

Add iframes for ipns website and Mauve blog

---

class: center, middle

## Next ü•≥

- Partner with projects
- Extensions over p2p
- Customizable shell
- `earthstar://` `bt://` `eth://`
- Mesh networks / Mixnets
- Example webapps

???

Here's some cool stuff on our roadmap

We'd like to partner with projects that could make use of this tech

We want to be able to load extensions over p2p protocols

We want to make the shell fully customizable

We want to add more protocols like earthstar and bittorrent

We want better out-of-the-box support for mesh networks

And we want to start showcasing example local-first web apps for others to build off of
