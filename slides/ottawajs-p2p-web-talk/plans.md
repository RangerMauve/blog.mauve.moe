# ottawajs-p2p-web-talk
My presentation on the P2P web, focusing on Dat and the Beaker Browser

# Plans

- Quick demo
    - Make a site using Beaker
    - Load it
- What _is_ the P2P web
  - Centralization
    - Star topology diagram
    - Two people connect through the central node
    - If the central node is down, can't connect
  - P2P
    - Mesh topology diagram
    - Rout between two people
    - Alternate route between two people
- Why is Centralization so popular
  - Setting up a website is hard
  - DNS
  - Servers
  - Costs for bandwidth
  - Businesses want to control the data for profit
- Why has made P2P hard to use
  - Difficult to discover peers
  - Traversing networks can be difficult to set up
  - Dealing with malicious peers
  - Lack of easy-to-use tech
- Dat
  - Created to help share scientific data securely
  - Data is shared by linking to a URL
    - The URL is a public key used for encryption
    - Peers are found on the network using a discovery key that's derived from the public key
    - If someone doesn't know the URL, they can't see the data
  - Backed by append-only logs (hypercore)
    - Kinda like a blockchain, but the fundemental building block it's based on
    - Can load parts of the log from any peer and know that it's valid
    - Structure is efficiently stored such that you only need to get the subset that you want
  - High level API looks like a filesystem
    - Can read/write files and directories
    - Can watch for filesystem changes
  - The data is versioned
    - Can look at the change history
    - Can check out an older version
  - Repliation diagram
    - Two sides with blocks
    - Some blocks are greyed out
    - Arrows representing downloads
  - Offline first
    - If you've viewed a Dat, the files you viewed are cached locally and available offline
    - Can work with data locally and sync with others eventually when you're both online
- Discovery-swarm
  - Bittorrent DHT
    - Diagram of DHT
    - Can publish your IP address to advertise yourself to peers
    - Can find peers for data you want
  - MDNS
    - Advertise on local network
    - Discover local machines without an internet connection
- Beaker Browser
    - Make sure [logo](dat://beakerbrowser.com/img/logo/logo.png) is displayed over `#5743ff` background
    - Experimental browser
    - Based on Electron
    - Able to load `dat://` urls
    - Provides interfface for creating and managing "dat sites"
    - JavaScript API for manipulating Dat archives
    - Demo: WYSIWYWiki
    - Demo Fritter
 - Outside of beaker
    - http://gateway.mauve.moe:300/
    - https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-polyfill
    - Can view and interact with Dat in any browser
    - Can create dats using the JS API with private keys being stored in the browser
    - Not as private or offline-friendly because the gateway sees what you access
    - [Fritter for web](http://gateway.mauve.moe:3000/fritter-web-rangermauve.hashbase.io)
 - Gotchas
    - When nobody is seeding a dat, new users can't get it
        - Easy to set up own "seeding" peer
        - https://hashbase.io/ does 200MB hosting for free (open source service) https://hashbase.io/assets/images/logo.png
        - No vendor lock in since anyone can set up hosting for your dat
    - When a file is updated in a Dat, the full file is saved in the history
        - Prefer smaller files
        - Split up large data sets
 - What to do with this
    - Centralization is empowering large corporations to build monopolies
    - They control what data you can share, who you can share it to, and what data you can see
    - It enables advertisers to learn everything about you
    - It makes it so that you _have_ to buy hosting if you want to get information on your own terms
    - The web was initially made to be decentralized, but its evolution has made it hard to do so
    - We need to connect people _together_, not via a third party
    - Instead of storing users data in a centralized repo, have users store their data in their own dats
        - Data is owned by users, they decide who sees it by sharing their URL
        - You don't need infrastructure to support them
        - Your apps can work offline or over local networks with zero internet
