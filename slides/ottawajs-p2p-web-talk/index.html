# P2P Web

(Press P for notes)

???

- Welcome!
- Today I'm going to be opening your mind to a new mode of web development
- At the end of this talk,
- you'll know a bit more about the hidden tradeoffs in regular web application development,
- and how we can work around these tradeoffs with Peer To Peer technology

# ü§∑ ü§∑ ü§∑Ô∏è

???

- What _is_ the P2P web?
- Create a new website
- Say "Hello Forward JS"
- URL on twitter (via gateway)

# Centralization

![Star topology - Nodes connected to the center](/star.svg)

???

- Centralization is the default mode of accessing data these days
- When two peopl want to exchange data, they use a well-known third party in order to relay the data between them

---

class: center, middle

# Oops ‚Äº

![Star Topology - Center node is missing](/star-missing.svg)

???

- If the central node is down, or if it decides not to connect the two people, everything stops working
- In this case, it's more than just the server burning in a fire
- If a client doesn't have a direct internet connection,
- Amazon has downtime,
- Or the server is just overloaded with too many connections
- Suddenly your app doesn't work

---

class: center, middle

# Decentralization / P2P

![Mesh topology diagram](/mesh.svg)

???

- The opposite is Decentralization or P2P
- People interested in data will connect to others directly and will exchange information with each other
- If you want to get data from a person, you get it directly from them, or through any peer that's also connected to them

---

class: center, middle

# Yay ‚Äº

![Mesh topology, direct connection is missing](/mesh-missing.svg)

???

- If a peer is missing in a P2P network, you can get data from the others in the swarm
- Data can live in the network outside of the peers that originally created it

---

class: middle

# Why Centralization?

- Websites are hard! üò≠
- Servers üò®
- Bandwdith üò©
- DNS üò∞
- Control üòà

???

- Building websites is hard, you need to worry about a whole bunch of moving parts
- You need to set up servers (hardware and software)
- You need to worry about paying for bandwidth if you suddenly get popular
- You need to set up a DNS record to have a domain name for your website
- And generally centralization leads to having tight control over platforms

---

class: middle

# Why not P2P?

- Peer discovery üòû
- Network traversal üòï
- Malicious peers üëø
- No easy-to-use apps ü§≥

???

- In order for P2P to work, you need to think more about how to actually find peers to connect to
- As well, not all peers are even connectable. Certain networks like Universities or Corporate networks are really strict with what sort of traffic can be sent over it.
- You also need to design your system with the risk of there being malicious peers that might try to exploit it
- And finally, there haven't been that many apps that "just work" without you needing to be an uber nerd

class: middle, center, purplebg

# ü§î Why now? ü§î

???

- New technology created to overcome problems
- Buzz in development sphere about decentralized tech
- Centralization on the web is proving harmful

class: center, middle

![Dat hexegon logo](/dat-data-logo.svg)

???

- The Dat project is my favorite technology in this space
- Created to distribute versioned scientific data
- Backed by a non-profit organization
- Funded by grants so there's no VC funding expecting exponential returns on investment

---

class: center, middle, datbg

[dat://d3f8f648fdcca1925bdb0b601d723ec8960cb9ec88cad49aae785ed5eb3367b0/](dat://d3f8f648fdcca1925bdb0b601d723ec8960cb9ec88cad49aae785ed5eb3367b0)

???

- At a high level Dat uses these links to share data
- The link contains the hex for a public key used for singing content, and used for encryption
- Unless somebody has this URL, they are incapable of accessing your data

---

class: center, middle

# It's just files and folders!

![Filesystem Diagram](/files.svg)

???

- Dat URLs point to "Archives" which are containers with files and folders
- You can use Dat to sync data with a folder on your computer, or use it to view files in a browser
- Having a filesystem gives a lot of flexability with how you can store your data
- You write your file to the Dat Archive, share the link using the Dat URL, and the peer will download it from the P2P network

---

class: center, middle

# BLOCKCHAINZ üòÇ üëå üî•

![Append Only Log Diagram](/log.svg)

???

- The underlying data is represented in an append-only-log
- This is the general purpose data structure that "blockchain" technology is based on
- The idea is that each new entry in the log points at the previous one
- When a file is changed, the data is added to the "content log", and the information about the change is added to the "metadata log"
- This means that you can download the history of the dat without having to download all the files in that history

---

class: center, middle

# Only download what's needed

![Replication diagram](/replication.svg)

???

- The peers use the dat URL as a "secret key" in order to establish an encrypted connection
- Each new item in the log is signed by the public key from the URL, this means that you can download blocks from any peer and know that they're valid
- Peers look at the latest blocks that they have locally in order to only download what's needed

---

class: center, middle, purplebg

# üëÄ How do you find peers? üëÄ

???

- Should be able to discover peers for the dat URL
- Should not expose the dat URL to the network to keep it secret
- Should work over the internet, and on local networks

---

class: center, middle

# Distributed Hash Tables

![DHT circle diagram](/dht.svg)

???

- Distributed hash tables are a way for a P2P network store and retrieve data
- A p2p network is formed where keys are evenly distributed between all nodes in the network
- The most popular implementation is called the Kademlia DHT which uses a "logical distance" function to distribute connections
- This is used in the BitTorrent network to discover peers for a torrent without any centralization
- A "discovery key" is used to identify data, and peers that hold the data write to multiple nodes in the network that are "close" to the key
- Peers looking to get the data then query the DHT to find those peers and connect to them to download

---

class: center, middle

# Multicast DNS


![Multicast DNS diagram](/mdns.svg)

???

- MDN is a protocol used to find peers on a local network
- It works similar to the DHT where a discovery key is broadcast to the network along with an IP address and port
- Peers will listen on MDNS event on their local network to find other local peers

---

class: center, middle

![Dat project background](/dat-data-logo.svg)

---

class: middle, datbg


- Working with data is simple
- Dat URLs are easy to share
- End-to-end encrypted
- Offline / Local friendly

---

class: center, middle, beakerbg

# Beaker

![Beaker browser logo](/beaker-logo.png)

???

- Dat is useful, but it's geared towards sharing files, not applications
- Beaker is a new experimental browser that's incorporating peer to peer technologies with the web
- It allows loading Dat URLs directly in your browser
- In addition to loading data from the Dat network, it provides tools for creating Dat archives that can be used as websites
- Provides JavaScript APIs for creating, reading, and manipulating dat Archives

ü§î But what about Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge ü§î

???

- Beaker is awesome, but not everybody is ready to switch their browser, plus it doesn't exist on mobile yet

[Firefox extension](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/dat-webext)

[JS API](https://github.com/datproject/dat-js)

???

- You can use the "dat gateway" in order to access any dat URLs from a regular browser
- You can either use my public instance, or set up a local instance for greater privacy
- Dat-Webext is a Firefox extension Sam Macbeth which lets you use firefox to view Dat URLs and provides the DatArchive API

---

class: center, middle

![Hashbase logo](/hashbase-logo.png)

???

- Peers can only download data if there are available peers to download it from
- If you want to guarantee that your data is available, hashbase is a hosting service that will ensure there's at least one peer online for others to replicate from
- It gives you 200 MB free for your account, and provides an HTTPS subdomain for easy sharing
- This is different from other hosting providers because they just act as a single peer in the P2P network and you can migrate away from them with zero reprucusions

```
npm install -g dat

dat clone dat://d3f8f648fdcca1925bdb0b601d723ec8960cb9ec88cad49aae785ed5eb3367b0

cd ~/mywebsite

dat create
```

???

- You can also interact with Dat from the CLI
- You can clone Dat archives to a local folder
- Or publish a website to the Dat network from a folder with static files

---

class: center, middle

# ü§¶ Gotchas ü§¶

- Need peers to keep content online
- URLs need to be kept secret
- History keeps track of full files
- Knowing the URL means knowing IPs

???

- If you don't expect to have Beaker open all the time to seed your data, you should use either Hashbase or create a dedicated peer
- Make sure to only share your URLs with trustworthy people because there's no way to revoke access
- When files are updated in the history, the entire file is re-added to the content log
- This means that changing large files will create a bunch of duplicate data which can be hard to maintain
- Splitting up large datasets into multiple files makes it cheaper to do updates to content
- Regarding privacy, if somebody knows a Dat URL, they could potentially track which Peers IP addresses are seeding the data

class: center, middle, purplebg

# üòµ What should I do with this? üòµ

???

- Apps made with Dat are offline-first, let you skip back-ends and hosting costs
- Centralization, corporations, monopolies
- Your data is being controlled, and you cannot choose who sees it and what you get to see
- The web was originally created to enable people to build their own websites and control their own data
- This technology is going to support that vision by bringing the power back into the hands of users instead of middle-men
