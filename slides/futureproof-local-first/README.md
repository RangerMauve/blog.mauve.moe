- Local First Thinking (10)
    - Outline
    - Advantages
    - Disasvantages
        - Content less reliable if provider offline
        - Can be slower for initial load
        - Aggreggating lots of data is harder
        - No central place to moderate content
        - Harder to monetize (no rent-seeking, no data harvesting by default!)
    - Social Impacts
- Building blocks (10)
    - Peer to Peer protocols
    - Content addressability
    - Encryption
    - Gossip protocols
    - Subjective Moderation
    - Mesh Networks
- Use cases (20)
    - Marginalized people getting censored on platforms (e.g. queer people, activists)
    - Low (or no) connectivity environments
    - Disaster-prone communities with needs for resilience
- Existing Applications (10)
    - Berty Chat (uses libp2p/IPFS, local networks, bluetooth)
    - Manyverse (SecureScuttlebutt, local networks, bluetooth)
    - Mapeo (Hypercore, local networks)
    - Pushpin (Hypercore, local networks)
    - Agregore Browser (hypercore,ipfs,ssb,bittorrent, local networks ad-hoc wifi)
- Breakout (Folks will split into groups and write ideas into hackmd) (15)
    - What have you experienced that would benefit from local first
    - List some ways this mindset works outside just the technical realm
- Reading some of the results (10)
- What can you do next (5)
    - Think about what communities aren't served by the cloud and by centralized thinking
    - Work with them to take back control and to make things more resilient and community centric by default
