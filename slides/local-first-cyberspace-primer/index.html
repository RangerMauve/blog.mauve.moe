# üï∏ Local First Cyberspace - Primer üï∏

???

Hey all! I'm RangerMauve, or just Mauve, and I'll be talking about my vision for a Local First Cyberspace.

# üåê The Web Is Cyberspace üåê

???

So, I think that we already have a cyberspace that's got a lot of cool properties.

You can create data and load it on any device, navigate through it, and render data as fancy graphics.

The web brings a lot of flexability and interoperability to virtual reality, but I think it's still missing a piece to realize it's full potential.

## ü§î Local First Software ü§î

???

So what is local-first software?

---

class: center, middle

# üìÑ -> üíª

???

Basically, it's software that saves your data locally, works offline, and then lets you share data over the local network or internet.

---

class: center, middle

# üìÑ -> ‚òÅüòà -> üíª

???

This is the opposite of cloud based approaches where data is stored in a cloud service, and then it gives you access over the network.

Cloud based services, by virtue of centralizing everyone's data, services end up creating walled gardens.

# üß± Walled Gardens Suck üß±

???

For instance, I can‚Äôt publish a VR app on Oculus unless I jump through a bunch of hoops and have them approve me.

Similarly, if I want to create something that competes with them, or something that isn't polished enough to go in a store, they can prevent me from being able to share that thing with people.

# üòà Centralization üòà

## Leads To

# üß± Walled Gardens üß±

???

The web helps a lot with the walled garden in that developers can publish stuff without needing to go through a central gatekeeper.

But it's not enough because what ends up happening is that the people publishing platforms on the web end up creating their own, smaller, walled gardens.

## People should own their reality

???

Building cyberspace, or the metaverse, or whatever it's called, on large centralized platforms will make it harder for people to innovate and will be disasterous for when the platforms crash.

For example, when discord goes down as a service, everyone relying on it for their community suddently loses the ability to communicate.

I want anybody to jack into their VR headset, and enter their own personal VR space that will exist regardless of whether some server is online and giving them access to their data, and I want them to be in full control of their space even without internet..

I want people to create a new space and send a link to their friend without registering it anywhere or having some server sharing it. If their friend is nearby they should send the data without even touching the internet.

And that should be the standard for all content. Videos and audio that you‚Äôve got loaded on your phone should be loadable by other people in your house without using up more data.

![Dat logo](./dat-logo.png)

???

So, this is all pretty fun to talk about, but how do we achieve this reality.

I‚Äôm currently working on the Dat project which is a Peer To Peer file sharing protocol.

The gist of it is that it's ‚ÄúLike BitTorrent for Websites, but faster, mutable, and private‚Äù.

???

So, the way it works, is you create some files for your website. The HTML / JavaScript / CSS and stuff.

Then you create a ‚Äúdat archive‚Äù which is a folder you can shove files into, and share with people using a link.

---

class: center, middle

![Network Diagram](./dht.svg)

???

When you want to download the archive, you search the P2P networking for somebody that has it, and once you've downloaded it you stat resharing it.

So people can't see your data unless you give them the link, and the more people have a copy of the data the more it's reshared.

# [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/)

# [Cliqz Browser](https://cliqz.com/en/latest)

# [Cliqz Mobile Concept Browser](https://github.com/cliqz/cliqz-concept-browser)

???

So, dat started out as being a command line tool and some desktop apps for sharing scientific data, but it‚Äôs been used more and more on the web.

There‚Äôs currently two web browsers with support for Dat.

Beaker, which was the original and is based on Electron and Chromium, and Cliqz which is based on Firefox and is actually just bundling a Firefox extension for the Dat support.

Cliqz is also experimenting with a mobile browsr on Android, which is pretty exciting.

These browsers let you load webistes from the P2P web, and author websites from right in your browser.

# üíª Local-First Cyberspace üíª

???

So, when you combine local-first software, with the web. You get a foundational building block that I think can fundamentally change how we interact with data and what sorts of experiences we can create.

My goal this summer is to get Dat integrated with Exokit so that we can load VR content from the P2P web within different headsets.

What I also want is to have tooling for peopel to start duplicating VR worlds and editing them themselves.

# üî• Freedom & Innovation üî•

???

What I really want is to give both developers and users to have more freedom inside VR worlds and to make it easier for people to play around with ideas and innovate on how we interact with our software.
