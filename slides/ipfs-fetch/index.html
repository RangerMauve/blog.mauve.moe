# IPFS-In Agregore

<small>Press <b>P</b> for speaker notes</small>

Hi Everyone.

Today I'm going to talk about my love of the web, peer to peer networks, and how I've combined those things into a web-like interface for IPFS.

I'm Mauve, or @RangerMauve.

I do consulting through my company Mauve Software Inc.

And I'm high key obsessed with peer to peer and local first software

# üåêüíú Web Good üíúüåê

???

I really love the web.

- Easy to start with HTML and a bit of JS
- Cross platform, evrything has a browser
- Content / app distribution

# üñ•Ô∏è üò¢ Servers Bad üò¢üñ•Ô∏è 

???

Sadly the web is currently tightly coupled with web servers.

This was better than having no web, but it introduces some problems.

- Needs more expertise to get right
  - Scaling is hard
  - Security harder
  - More code to learn and set up
- Needs internet
  - Need internet to author content
  - Need internet to load content
  - Hard to get an offline-first flow working
  - Loading a file betwen two devices requires world-wide round trip
- Usually need money to keep going
  - Needs credit card and housing
- Third party hosting means you don't own your data
  - Might shut down and take your data / community down
  - Breaking changes to your site or hosting which you can't revert

# üåüü§© P2P Good ü§©üåü

???

Thankfully, there's something that's been getting popular lately which removes the need for servers.

Thins brings with it certain advantages over regular server-based tech.

### P2P Good

- Stuff works offline-frist
- Shove some files in a folder and you're good
- No need for extra code for servers
- Can work without a third party
- Internet is an upgrade for more connections

## ü§î P2P + Web Good? ü§î

???

Right now the websites that use P2P protocols usually get served from a webserver and have custom javascript APIs or extensions that are required to get anything done.

What would it look like if browsers had protocols like IPFS integrated into their cores the way they do with HTTP?

## HTTP Web Is:

- URLs
- GET / POST / DELETE
- Load Pages / Media / Scripts
- `fetch()`

---

class: middle, ipfsbg

## P2P Web Is:

- GET `ipfs://SomeHash` or `ipns://ipfs.io`
- POST `ipfs:///file.txt` => `ipfs://SomeHash`
- PUBLISH `ipns://somename/`

# Agregore Browser

???

Although you can use ipfs-fetch in your Node.js or Web based projects, those will be different than having it integrated into the environment itself.

For that you could make use of Agregore which is an electron-based p2p browser.

- Built in Protocols
- Minimalist design
- Made to be extended with extensions
- Multi-Protocol

# üéâ Demo Time üéâ

???

- Open up dev tools (assuming in Agregore Browser)
- Author a simple HTML page
- POST into IPFS
- PUBLISH to IPNS
- Load URL

# Finishing Thoughts

???

- Make stuff
- Make stuff simple
- Make stuff resilient
