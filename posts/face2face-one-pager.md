# Face 2 Face - A foundation for social P2P applications

## Goal

To create a building block for peer to peer social networks which allows people to form communities without having to rely on central authorities or steady internet connections.
This project will use established open source technology (BitTorrent, React-Native) and be based on existing standards for social media formats (ActivityPub) in order to make it easier to reproduce and to be more of an open standard than a walled garden.
The project will be a more privacy-conscious alternative to existing social media platforms that do excessive monitoring of users and are restrictive in the content that they could post.
The project is also going to address constraints of people with poor or no internet connectivity by making everything work offline or on local networks without internet.

## Impact

> Why is this project useful? Why do your users, or potential users, like it so much? Where will it be in five years?

The internet and social media have become an essential portion of human culture and interaction.
Platforms like Facebook and Tumblr have control over large communities and recently we've seen the downsides to this centralization with Facebook selling private browsing data and messages, and Tumblr blocking a large portion of their userbase.
The web was envisioned to connect people directly together but we ended up with a web where people can only connect through a third party, which prevents them from connecting if the connection to the third party isn't there, and gives this third party control over how they can interact and what they see.
This project will set the foundation for people to build alternative networks that don't have the constraints of existing centralized ecosystems.

More tech-savvy users are learning about the downsides of centralization, and initial interviews with younger people is showing their interest in having an alternative platform.\
The main positive feedback heard was the higher privacy and ownership of ones data compared to existing platforms.

If this takes off, the future will see more apps being built on the foundational specifications of the project much like how ActivityPub has resulted in an ecosystem of different projects.
This will make it easier for devlopers to create decentralied apps, and will give more choice and control to users using these apps.

## Traction

> Try to collect evidence that your project matters, whether itâ€™s metrics, anecdotes, or testimonials. Are there any companies or noteworthy people using your project right now? If not, has a prominent person endorsed it?

P2P social media platforms are popping up and a lot of people are talking about how P2P and decentralization is getting more mainstream.
ActivityPub and Mastodon have made the idea of federated social networks that have many small centralized sources instead of one large source popular.
Mastodon is a great start to expose people to other forms of social media, but it still largely has a lot of the flaws of larger and more centralized platforms.
A lot of people in the decentralization space are focusing on cryptocurrencies and are largely looking to create their own walled garden and to profit off of data being exchanged in it.
This project doesn't rely on any cryptocurrencies and builds on existing and open standards. This will make it easier for people to create their own implementations and is geared towards empowering people rather than monetizing them.
Cloudflare has recently embraced IPFS (a P2P file transfer protocol) by creating a gateway that people can use to load IPFS content in their web browsers.

## Value to funder

> Funders, whether your employer or a grantmaking foundation, are frequently approached with opportunities. Why should they support your project over any other opportunity? How do they personally benefit?

// TODO

## Use of funds

> What, exactly, will you accomplish with the proposed funding? Focus on project milestones or outcomes rather than paying a salary.

Doing the research with potential users, making the specification, and implementing a working version.
Some funding for cheap Android phones to test how P2P will work on actual devices.
Funding to hire a graphic designer to make sure the user interface and user experience will be appealing to people.

Milestones:

- Determine limits of transferring social data with BitTorrent on Android
- Survey people (20?) and find what features they would need in a social media app
- Formalize feature set and build specification for data format and exchange (based on BitTorrent and ActivityPub)
- Sketch out user interface with a graphic designer
- Build MVP of the Android app
- Identify potential users or communities and get it in their hands
- Design a website to explain how it works, and share it amongst P2P folks
- Get user feedback and improve the usability
- Make the app work on iOS
- Make the app work on Windows / Mac / Linux
