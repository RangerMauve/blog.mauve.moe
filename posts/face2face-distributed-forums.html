<h2 id="face2face-f2f-">Face2Face (f2f)</h2>
<p>One of the killer apps that Dat is missing is a web forum where people can get together and converse without the need for any centralized servers.</p>
<p>Think of the early web where you&#39;d have &quot;Topics&quot; with posts and threads that you had to refresh every few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="why-now-">Why Now?</h3>
<p>Being fully p2p was hard with Dat since you would need to have some sort of message channel to exchange Dat URLs with other people in your network.</p>
<p>One of the cool features that have come with the latest <a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/releases/tag/0.8.0-prerelease.7">Beaker 0.8.0 prerelease</a> is the experimental <code>datPeers</code> API.</p>
<p>When you access a Dat, what happens in the background is that Beaker will search for peers that have the Dat content and connect to them.</p>
<p>This means that we&#39;re forming networks with other people that are interested in the data you&#39;re looking at.</p>
<p>The <code>datPeers</code> API gives you the ability to communicate with this network.</p>
<p>This gives us a way to find peers without having to rely on any centralized service.</p>
<h3 id="then-what-">Then what?</h3>
<p>The <code>datPeers</code> API allows you to broadcast some data to every peer you connect to. Say, a Dat URL for the posts you&#39;ve made for your posts.</p>
<p>That way, you can look for peers that are also looking for your forums and start indexing their Dat URLs while they index your posts.</p>
<p>This can be extended by having peers write the URLs of others to their own Dat, which will then be indexed by everyone.</p>
<p>The end result is that everybody will have a list of all other peers&#39; URLs and they&#39;ll all be indexing each others posts.</p>
<h3 id="cool-how-is-this-a-forum-">Cool, how is this a forum?</h3>
<p>Now that you have a way to get posts from everyone, you need to have an agreement on what the posts are.</p>
<p>The easiest approach would be to look at how <a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/libfritter">fritter</a> does it.</p>
<p>People could have a <code>profile.json</code> to describe their accounts, and they could have a <code>/posts</code> directory for all of their posts.</p>
<p>Similar to how Fritter works, new &quot;threads&quot; in the forum would be posts that don&#39;t have a parent.</p>
<p>Replies would all link to the parent post.</p>
<p>The post contents would be written in markdown, and would use the same &quot;mentiones&quot; array as fritter.</p>
<h3 id="indexing-">Indexing?</h3>
<p>Duplicating all the contents within indexedDB sounds like it&#39;ll be a bit of a pain.</p>
<p>I think that it would be safe to instead store an index using the thread root + the timestamp.</p>
<p>That way you could search for slices of posts for your current view and fetch the actual post contents from the given DatArchive.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-when-nobody-s-online-">What about when nobody&#39;s online?</h3>
<p>The cool thing about the <code>datPeers</code> API, is that it can also be used within node.js using <a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dat-node">@beaker/dat-node</a>.</p>
<p>This it should be easy to set up servers which will automatically crawl and replicate the Dat archives of participants.</p>
<h3 id="how-will-communities-work-">How will communities work?</h3>
<p>The idea is that creating a new forum will be as simple as forking the base Dat and sharing the URL with your peers</p>
<p>The cool thing here is that there&#39;s no single point that people need to connect to.</p>
<p>Instead, you can talk to people directly, either over the internet, or even over your local network.</p>
<p>Even if the original creator of the forum archive goes away, the community can still move their data elsewhere.</p>
<p>Customizing the forums doesn&#39;t require any services, just some CSS and HTML knowledge which could be abstracted for non-technical users.</p>
<p>Using the same building blocks as Fritter for the data means that posts are more portable and that they could be linked through other viewers like Rotonde.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this would be a useful tool and a powerful demonstration of distributed web software.</p>
