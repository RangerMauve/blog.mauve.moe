<h1 id="a-node-esm-loader-for-the-web-and-p2p">A Node ESM loader for the Web and P2P</h1>
<h2 id="the-state-of-ecmascript-modules">The state of EcmaScript Modules</h2>
<p>There&#39;s been a lot of buzz about the new EcmaScript Module specification that&#39;s landed in JavaScript a while ago.</p>
<p>Originally, it was only used by tools like Babel to bring new syntax for describing modules and how they can be bundled together.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import">browsers</a> have started supporting the spec natively. This means that people can make applications <em>today</em> that make use of a first-class module system in JavaScript, without having to have a build step!</p>
<p>What&#39;s also exciting is that Node.js now also has support for these modules behind an <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html">experimental flag</a>.</p>
<h2 id="there-s-a-catch-">There&#39;s a catch!</h2>
<p>Even though we have this cool new language feature, transitioning to it is going to be hard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js only supports ESM modules with files that have a <code>.mjs</code> file extension (which doesn&#39;t make sense on the web)</li>
<li>People are still trying to make use of modules geared towards Node and CommonJS which won&#39;t work without a build step on the web</li>
<li>Node.js only supports loading modules through the <code>file:</code> protocol. This means you can&#39;t load a module through <code>https</code> like you would on the web.</li>
<li>Even if you make a module using ESM that could be imported on both platforms, Node.js lacks most of the APIs that exist in the browser which means people need Node-specific modules for them</li>
<li>Setting up build tools to get this stuff to work in Browsers is complex (why should we have to?)</li>
<li>Modules published on NPM can&#39;t be <code>import</code>ed on the web, they have to be processed by build tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2>
<p>The current project that&#39;s leading the way in making ESM nice to use in Node is the aptly named <a href="https://github.com/standard-things/esm">esm</a> module.</p>
<p>It parses your code and makes it so you can import and export modules using the new syntax. This is a step above what Node does by default and lets you configure the behavior without having to set up complex build tools.</p>
<p>However, I believe that it doesn&#39;t focus enough on bringing the web into Node and is mostly useful if you&#39;re focused on reusing your existing Node-specific code.</p>
<p>As well, it does a lot more than just plug into the ESM module loader and does a bunch of parsing and transpiling to make things work.</p>
<h2 id="my-approach">My approach</h2>
<p>What I want is for people to be able to make modules that work in both Node and the browser.</p>
<p>Peope have mostly been approaching this from the side of Node, trying to get Node modules to run in browsers by specifying globals and using build tools.</p>
<p>What I propose is to go the other direction: Make browser-first modules, and modify Node to be able to run them.</p>
<p>To acheive this I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make most JS modules loadable in (modern, evergreen) browsers without complex build tools</li>
<li>Allow Node.js to load modules through HTTPS</li>
<li>Provide essential APIs like <code>fetch</code> and <code>Websocket</code> in Node</li>
<li>Ditch legacy support for Node modules in favor of modern JS and browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>With these goals in mind, I&#39;ve created <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rangermauve/web-loader">@rangermauve/web-loader</a>.</p>
<p>It works by using the new <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_loader_hooks">loader hooks</a> in Node.js to intercept <code>import</code> calls.</p>
<p>When it encounters an <code>https://</code> or <code>dat://</code> URL, it will download the relevant file to a temporary folder, and tell node to load it.</p>
<p>This allows you to import any module you want from a web server and cache it locally to prevent unncessary network traversal.</p>
<p>This also means that you can start using modules without having to have centralized registries.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I&#39;ve added some globals to Node which allow you to use modules geared for HTTP requests and websockets without having to use node-specific APIs</p>
<p>This means you can write your code as though it was in the browser (or an environment like React-Native) and have it <code>Just Workâ„¢</code> in all environments.</p>
<h2 id="peer-to-peer-decentralization">Peer to Peer / Decentralization</h2>
<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been really into the P2P web scene. My favorite protocol at the moment is <a href="https://datproject.org/">Dat</a> which models it&#39;s data as a versioned filesystem which you can share with people using a secret URL while distributing the load across the network.</p>
<p>This protocol is currently only available in Node.js and the <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">Beaker Browser</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to share files, you can update them (unlike BitTorrent) and have those changes propogate to peers. In addition, there is a version history for every change made, this makes it easy for people to view older versions of files without having to worry about them being changed or corrupted.</p>
<p>These properties are ideal for distributing code: Only owners of the private key that created an archive can add changes, you can easily checkout older versions or pin your import to a specific version, and anybody can create a Dat archive to share which avoids name conflicts.</p>
<p>As such, I&#39;ve added support for <code>import</code>ing <code>dat://</code> URLs, and have added the <a href="dat://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat.html">DatArchive</a> global which is used for accessing and creating Dat archives in Beaker.</p>
<p>As with <code>https://</code> imports, this is cached to disk in order to avoid unncessary network trips. A benefit here is that modules are fetched from a p2p network, and adding different ways to seed your data doesn&#39;t change how it&#39;s imported (unlike registries).</p>
<p>At the moment it doesn&#39;t bother to re-seed the content, but that might be addressed in a future version.</p>
<p>If any distributed web folks are interested in seeing their favorite protocols integrated in the loader, feel free to send a PR or raise an issue talking about your use case.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-with-it">What to do with it</h2>
<p>I suggest people start making browser-first, or ESM-first modules and start thinking about alternatives to loading them compared to what we&#39;ve been doing in Node with NPM.</p>
<p>Instead of setting up crazy build tools, try using the existing infrastructure in the web platform, or start publishing ESM modules that provide better interfaces to it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve recently been working on some small side projects using modern JS code, and it feels so refreshing to not have to set up webpack configs and huge <code>node_module</code> folders.</p>
<p>I want to bring that same experience when developing scripts with Node.</p>
<p>Try it out, and feel free to send feedback on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/RangerMauve">Twitter</a> or raise issues on <a href="https://github.com/RangerMauve/node-web-loader/issues">Github</a></p>
