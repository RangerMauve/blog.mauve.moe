<p>Currently, Hashbase is the ideal place to go if you want a reliable host to seed your data.</p>
<p>This is great for getting people started with seeding, but it introduces a point of centralization that relies on connectivity to the hashbase servers, and it makes it harder to migrate lists of seeded archvies away to other providers or your own hosts.</p>
<p>Adding a Dat URL to be seeded by some service should be as easy as creating the Dat in the first place.</p>
<p>I think that a person&#39;s seed list should be contained in a dat archive, and you should share that archive URL with a seeding service in order for it to start seeding your stuff.</p>
<p>This will make it even easier to switch between seeding services since you won&#39;t have to try to manually copy all of your URLs to the new provider.</p>
<p>This also opens up the possability for the list to be self hosting.</p>
<p>The idea is that within the seed list archive, you have a JS file which uses <code>import.meta.url</code> to get its archive URL and creates <code>DatArchive</code>s for each URL being seeded, and listens for changes in the list using <code>archive.watch()</code>.</p>
<p>This can then be opened in <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com">Beaker</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/RangerMauve/webrun">webrun</a>.</p>
<p>If somebody wants to start using a seed list, then can open up the template seeder archive, fork it, and send the new URL somewhere (webrun, or a seeder service).</p>
<p>If a person wants to set up a personal seeding service, they would no longer need to figure out how to set up <a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/homebase">homebase</a> and get something going with a forked Dat and a single command line command.</p>
<p>After you have the URL shared somewhere, you can use a web page within the archive itself to start adding and removing archives from the list.</p>
<p>You can do this while offline and it will eventually get synced with whatever is seeding the content thanks to Dat&#39;s built-in replication.</p>
<p>With all this in place you now have a standard way of managing your seeded archives, and it&#39;s all offline / p2p first.</p>
